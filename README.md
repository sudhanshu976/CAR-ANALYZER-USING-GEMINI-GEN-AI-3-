# Car Analyzer using GEMINI

## Overview

This Streamlit application utilizes Google's GEMINI-Pro Vision model for analyzing car images, predicting car models, estimating prices, and providing additional specifications. Users can upload an image of a car, and the system generates a response with the predicted car details.

## Setup

1. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pillow google
   ```

2. Set up a Google API key by creating a `.env` file in the project directory and adding the following line:
   ```env
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run car_analyzer.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Visit the Streamlit app in your browser.

2. Upload an image of a car.

3. Click the "ANALYZE THE CAR" button to trigger the GEMINI-Pro Vision model.

4. View the response, including the predicted car model, estimated price, and additional specifications.

## Code Structure

- `car_analyzer.py`: The main Python script containing the Streamlit app and GEMINI interaction logic.
